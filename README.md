# Raspi-cpp-accelerometer

In this code:

    The I2C protocol is used to communicate with the accelerometer. The wiringPiI2CSetup() function initializes the I2C communication, and wiringPiI2CReadReg16() reads the accelerometer data.

    The MQTT protocol is used to establish a connection with the MQTT broker and publish the accelerometer data. The mqtt::async_client class represents the MQTT client. mqtt::connect_options is used to specify the connection settings, and client.connect() establishes the connection. mqtt::message_ptr is used to create an MQTT message, and client.publish() sends the message to the MQTT broker.

Make sure to replace mqtt_broker_address with the actual IP or hostname of your MQTT broker. Additionally, modify the code to read accelerometer data based on the specific protocol used by your accelerometer. The addresses 0x3B, 0x3D, and 0x3F are placeholders and may not be correct for your device.
